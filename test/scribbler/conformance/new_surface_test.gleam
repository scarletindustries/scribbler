//// Unit P6-11 — the CAPSTONE backstop (proofs 1–4), the deliberately-authored half of the
//// Phase-6 close. This file confirms, it does not re-derive (D1): the whole-suite SIMD roll-up +
//// the R16 residual audit + the tier sweep are P6-10's (`simd_conformance_test`, `skipcount_test`,
//// `residual_audit_test`, `simd_differential_test`); the per-op runtime microscopes are P6-07/08's;
//// the `.ir` round-trip is P6-02's; the D3a/emit byte-identity is P6-06's. THIS file adds the ONE
//// thing only the terminal unit makes — a small set of programs authored to exercise the new nodes
//// DELIBERATELY, each driven through the REAL shipped deployment profiles so a single mis-lowered
//// op fails on a NAMED program under a NAMED mode rather than diffusely in a ~24k-assert `.wast`.
////
//// ## Proof 1 — SIMD spec-correct end-to-end (I1/I2/I3/I6/I7)
////
//// `simddot` (integer lanes: `v128.const`, `i16x8.splat`, `i32x4.dot_i16x8_s`, the saturating
//// `i16x8.add_sat_s` family, `i32x4.mul`/`max_s`, `extract_lane`), `simdxform` (float lanes:
//// `f32x4.splat`/`mul`/`add`/`sqrt`/`min` with single-rounding + the -0.0/NaN corners, plus
//// `i8x16.shuffle`, `v128.bitselect`, `i32x4.eq` → a lane mask), and `simdmem` (`v128.load`/`store`,
//// `load32_splat`, `store32_lane`/`load32_lane` through the bounds-checked `rt_mem` seam + an OOB
//// `v128.load` → trap). Each exports a SCALAR (an `extract_lane` reduction — capstone Deviation #2)
//// so it rides the exact byte-identical numeric `Outcome` used since Phase 2 while exercising the
//// full lane surface. A mis-lowered lane, a wrong lane order (endianness), a double-rounded `f32x4`
//// lane, or a mis-propagated NaN diverges HERE on a named program. Values are spec-sourced from the
//// vector-instruction semantics and cross-checked against wasmtime 46.0.1 (the baked `.wast` remains
//// the Tier-A oracle; P6-10 drives the ~24.3k `simd_*.wast` `assert_return`s for the full
//// `v128`-in/`v128`-out lane-wise proof — the capstone need not re-derive it).
////
//// ## Proof 2 — memory64 runs (I4/S9)
////
//// `mem64` declares a `(memory i64 1)`, grows past the i32 4 GiB ceiling (O(1) sparse watermark),
//// stores/loads an i64 at byte 2^32+40 (i64 addressing), reads the fresh region past 2^32 as zero,
//// grows beyond the DOCUMENTED page cap (`Binding.mem64_max_pages` = 2^32 pages) → `-1` allocating
//// nothing, and traps `out of bounds memory access` at `byte_len`. The 65537-page grow charges
//// `delta * page_bytes` fuel on success (`rt_mem.mem_grow`, R9 — a legitimate CPU bound), which
//// exceeds the default budget; the memory64 RUNTIME is therefore observed ORTHOGONALLY to the fuel
//// meter (a raised budget on the Safe bindings; `MeterOff` under Unsafe) — exactly as P6-06's e2e
//// used `MeterOff`. The fuel bound itself is proven by the Phase-4 fuel suites, not re-derived here.
//// memory64 ships on `paged` (+ `portable`); the over-cap 64-bit `atomics` edge is P6-08's
//// fail-closed gate (a categorized tier edge, not driven here — Deviation #3).
////
//// ## Proof 3 — cross-module function linking (I5/I6)
////
//// `xlink` (a `.wast` script driven through OUR own `parse_script` — the official `linking.wast` is
//// a categorized parse-skip at the pin, S13/§D, so the backstop is authored IN SCOPE, the P5-12
//// precedent): module `$a` exports two functions; `(register "a" $a)` publishes them as cross-module
//// capabilities; module `$b` imports and CALLS them across instances via the linker-built closure
//// (D3a — a HANDED-IN capability, never an ambient `apply` of an attacker-named `module:atom`). An
//// unsatisfied import fails closed at link time (`assert_unlinkable`). Green under Safe/`cell`, and
//// the report is identical under `unsafe`/`portable` (the cross-module dispatch composes the same).
////
//// ## Proof 4 — conformance-neutral by default (I7)
////
//// A module with no `v128`, one 32-bit memory, and no cross-module imports compiles BYTE-IDENTICALLY
//// to Phase-5 — the IR grew (`TV128`/`ConstV128`/`SimdOp`/`CallImport`) but the defaults route the
//// new surface away. The emitter-level byte-identity is unit P6-06's (`emit_core` test, confirmed
//// green in `gleam test`); THIS file adds the whole-Phase-1..5-corpus behavioural neutrality across
//// the MODE axis: the entire Phase-1..4 acceptance corpus (`combos.corpus_programs`) AND the Phase-5
//// new-surface programs (`reftab`/`bulkmem`/`multimem`) produce the SAME `Outcome` under Safe and
//// Unsafe Phase-6 code. A Phase-6 change that perturbed a Phase-5 result — a `TV128` arm leaking into
//// a numeric match, an effect-analysis miss letting the Aggressive optimizer reorder a legacy state
//// op now that `Simd` joined the pure set (S7), an i64-address plumbing change touching the 32-bit
//// path — would diverge HERE.
////
//// Spec anchors: the vector value/type model and vector-instruction semantics
//// (<https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/instructions.html#vector-instructions>), IEEE-754
//// single-rounding + SIMD NaN propagation (I3); the memory64 proposal + the memory instructions with
//// an i64 address type; §7 embedding + the reference-interpreter `(register …)` mechanism. Every
//// `.expected` value is the spec-sourced Tier-A oracle, so "green" means every spec-observable was
//// preserved, never "it compiled".
