//// The Phase-5 headline test (unit P5-11 §A) — the conformance skip-count movement, MEASURED and
//// guarded so a regression (a category silently going dark, a new uncategorised skip, a skip
//// creeping back) goes red instead of quietly inflating the count (D9, no silent truncation).
////
//// It runs the WHOLE pinned allowlist once under the Safe profile and asserts:
////   (a) `fail == 0`                       — the hard spec gate;
////   (b) `pass  > phase4_baseline_pass`    — the new reftype/bulk categories genuinely lit up;
////   (c) EVERY residual skip's reason is one of the ENUMERATED honest categories — a NEW kind of
////       skip (an engine construct that quietly went dark) turns this red;
////   (d) `skip <= max_residual_skips`      — a regression ceiling (a further inflation goes red);
////   (e) the residual EXCLUDING the two known emit gaps (multi-table `call_indirect`, imported-
////       global element-init) is BELOW the Phase-4 baseline of 409 — the material drop, honestly
////       stated once the two quantified engine gaps are discounted.
////
//// ## The MEASURED headline (Safe profile, full re-vendored allowlist WITH the SIMD file set — P6-10;
//// Phase-14 re-measured)
////
//// pass = 47734 (+1088 over the Phase-13 close 46646 — Phase 14 DROVE `table_copy.wast`'s cross-module
//// funcref-in-`elem`-segment asserts, which now BUILD + DISPATCH instead of skipping), fail = 0,
//// skip = 683 (−1088 over 1771 — the ~1080 `table_copy` cross-module residual is CLOSED). The
//// pre-Phase-13 baseline was pass = 46529 (+25004 over the 21525 Phase-5 close — the 59 `simd_*`
//// files, the single largest movement in the project's history). The remaining skip is dominated by
//// one MEASURED, categorised residual (never a false green — R16/S11):
////   1. **CLOSED by Phase 14 (measured):** `table_copy.wast`'s cross-module funcref-in-`elem`-segment
////      asserts — its verifier imports module `a`'s functions, initialises `elem` segments with
////      `ref.func` of those IMPORTED functions, then dispatches via `call_indirect`. Phase 14 landed
////      the `RefFuncImport` IR distinction + the D3a import-adapter closure (`link.call_import` over
////      the func-import slot), so the file is now FULLY driven — `table_copy.wast` = 1649/0/0, a
////      positive movement, NOT a residual. (The old "569 pass / 1080 residual" accounting is history.)
////   2. the ~511 SIMD **text-format** frontend asserts (`assert_malformed`/`assert_invalid` whose
////      `module_type` is `.wat`) — the WAT parser rejects SIMD text (S13: SIMD text is out of scope
////      for the parser), so they are a categorised parse-skip, never a silent drop. Every BINARY
////      SIMD assert (24281 `assert_return` + 54 `assert_trap`) PASSES.
//// Every other residual skip is a categorised out-of-scope construct (const-expr / imported-global
//// element-init, GC-proposal reftypes, `assert_exhaustion`). The multi-table `call_indirect` gap
//// (Phase-5's label) is GONE (landed in aa89228) — asserted empty below; the `UnknownFunction`
//// cross-module funcref-in-`elem` gap (Phase-14's) is CLOSED and MEASURED empty below.
