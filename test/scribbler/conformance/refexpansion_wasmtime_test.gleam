//// The new-surface Tier-B `wasmtime` differential (unit P5-11 §F.2) — OUR compiled output for the
//// self-contained bulk-memory / multi-memory functions agrees with the pinned `wasmtime` 46
//// (vendor/PIN) on authored inputs. Tier-B: `wasmtime` prints ints as signed decimal (not raw
//// bits), so it confirms a VALUE, complementing the Tier-A spec-sourced `.expected` (a stronger,
//// bit-exact check). SKIPS gracefully when `wasmtime` is not installed (recorded), like the existing
//// `wasmtime_test`. The functions are SELF-CONTAINED (one invoke each) because `wasmtime run
//// --invoke` runs one function per FRESH instance — no cross-call state.
