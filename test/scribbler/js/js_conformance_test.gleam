//// THE PHASE-7 HEADLINE (P7-09 §A / J4) — JS runs on the BEAM, measured differentially.
////
//// Drives the whole JS corpus (`corpus.programs()`) through Porffor -> carder -> BEAM under
//// `scribbler/porffor/host.binding()` — each program's vendored `.wasm` (Porffor 0.61.13's output)
//// run through the FULL pipeline via `scribbler/porffor/run.run` — and JUDGES each program's captured console
//// output byte-for-byte against Porffor's OWN execution (the baked `.expected`, itself the T13
//// `porf run` oracle cross-checked vs Node at vendor time). This is Tier-A: it needs no live
//// Porffor/Node (the baked reference always judges); the live re-confirmation is
//// `js_differential_test`.
////
//// It prints the coverage table and asserts the honest invariants (§A.2):
////  (a) fail == 0            — no program where Porffor compiled + carder ran but the BEAM output
////                             DIVERGED from Porffor's (a real carder bug);
////  (b) pass > 0             — a NON-VACUOUS set of real JS programs (arithmetic + control flow +
////                             functions + recursion + try/catch) runs on the BEAM and matches
////                             correct JS;
////  (c) no program silently drops — pass + fail + skips == total, and every skip is a typed
////                             `SkipCategory` (S11/D9), so a program going dark cannot hide.
////
//// MEASURED (Porffor 0.61.13, this machine): 52 pass / 0 fail / 3 skip (all
//// `PorfforVsNodeDivergence` — Porffor's own `-0` rendering + broken lexical-closure capture;
//// carder reproduces `porf run` byte-for-byte even on those three, so they are Porffor's bound,
//// not carder's — J8).
