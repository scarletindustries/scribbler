//// Unit P4-09 — the shipped `(state_strategy × mem_tier × table_tier)` combination matrix
//// and the ONE `binding_for/1` constructor that composes each coherent, policy-legal `Binding`
//// through the unit-07 profile/linker surface (D1: this suite never re-spells a `rt_mem_*`
//// module name — every tier→module coupling goes through `profiles.compose`/`resolve_tiers`/
//// `validate_binding`). It also carries the small, reused evaluation machinery every proof in
//// `test/scribbler/conformance/**` shares: the normalized spec-observable `Outcome`, the corpus
//// driver, and the two load-bearing checks (spec-correctness against `.expected` +
//// cross-combination byte-identity), so "did the tier change anything?" is a single `==` (D7/D8,
//// no change-detector).
////
//// This is a **support module** (no `_test` functions), imported by the conformance proof suites.
//// Spec anchors are cited per corpus program inside each `corpus/*.expected` (numerics
//// <https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/numerics.html>, bounds/traps

////
//// ## Scribbler's copy vs carder's
////
//// This is the WASM-driving copy: every program is read as `.wasm` bytes from
//// `test/scribbler/conformance/corpus` and driven through the frontend
//// (`scribbler/conformance/driver`). carder keeps its own copy that drives the same programs
//// as `.ir` SOURCE TEXT, since the backend has no wasm decoder.
////
//// One deliberate omission: carder's copy calls its test-only `nif_loader.reuse_if_available()`
//// for a `Nif` combo, so the tier-N ceiling drives the REAL native buffer when a dedicated
//// native test already attached the `.so`. That loader is a carder BACKEND test module and is
//// not importable from here, so `binding_for` never touches a NIF attachment. The `Binding` is
//// identical either way (the `mem_module` atom is the same) and `rt_mem_nif` delegates per-op to
//// the paged core when no NIF is loaded (byte-identical, MF3) — so `cell_nif` still links, runs,
//// and must equal the spec `.expected`; it simply exercises the delegating path here.
