//// Regression test for the CI-only Porffor differential flake: on a COLD npm cache (a fresh CI
//// runner), the FIRST `npx porffor <file>` invocation prints an install diagnostic to stderr —
//// `npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: porffor@0.61.13` —
//// which `ffi.run` folds into stdout, polluting the console reference the live differential
//// byte-compares (observed: `"npm warn exec …\nhello, beam\n"` vs the expected `"hello, beam\n"`).
//// `porffor.strip_npm_noise` removes npm's diagnostic lines so the oracle is robust regardless of
//// cache state. These assert the exact observed scenario + the warm-cache no-op.
