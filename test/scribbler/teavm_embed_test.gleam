//// The `embed` API (what host platforms like Dance use) must run TeaVM WASM GC guests: the
//// reference-typed `teavm.*` runtime imports resolve through `scribbler/host/teavm.providers()`
//// (term-native) while the embedder's numeric `host` dispatcher services the i32-only imports, and
//// the guest's IMPORTED linear memory is reachable through `mem_read`/`mem_write`. Two fixtures
//// prove it:
////   - compute.wasm — object allocation + virtual dispatch (call_ref) → 46 (instantiation + teavm imports)
////   - memtest.wasm — org.teavm.interop.Address raw linear-memory r/w → 49 (the IMPORTED memory works)
//// A stub `host` (never called — neither fixture imports a non-teavm function) stands in for the embedder.
////
//// **Providers are a grant, not a default.** Since the carder/scribbler split, carder's linker
//// hard-codes NO host module: the TeaVM namespaces are the frontend's to supply, so every
//// instantiation below goes through `embed.instantiate_with_providers(compiled, host,
//// teavm.providers())`. Plain `embed.instantiate/2` would fail to link these guests — which is the
//// intended fail-closed behaviour for a guest nobody granted the TeaVM runtime to.
