//// gleeunit entry for the spec-suite runner (Tier-A) — drives the PINNED allowlist fixtures
//// present in `fixtures/` through the REAL pipeline and reports honest pass/skip/fail counts
//// (D9: skips are visible, never silent).
////
//// ## Phase 3: conformance-neutral under BOTH profiles (F7, capstone §G)
////
//// Phase 3 adds no IR nodes and no spec files, so the counts do not move; the proof is that the
//// SAME green holds under BOTH derived profiles — which also delivers the spec-suite half of the
//// F2 optimizer-soundness claim (capstone §B). The suite runs twice:
////   - `driver.pipeline_with(profiles.safe())`   — Baseline optimizer + enforcing fuel;
////   - `driver.pipeline_with(profiles.unsafe())` — Aggressive optimizer + open runtime.
//// Both must reach `fail == 0 && pass > 0`. A single optimizer or mode regression on ANY
//// allowlisted assertion goes red. The Safe fuel budget for the suite (`default_fuel_budget`) is
//// generous enough that no in-scope program trips `FuelExhausted` (the runaway proof 4 uses a
//// tiny `safe_metered` budget instead).
////
//// ## Phase 4 — the full-matrix conformance proof (capstone P4-11 proof 2, G2/G7)
////
//// Phase 4 adds NO IR nodes and NO spec files either (G7), so the counts STILL do not move
//// (15747 / 411 / 0). The Phase-4 proof is that the identical green holds under EVERY shipped
//// `(state_strategy × mem_tier[× table_tier])` binding (`combos.shipped`) — not a subset:
////   - `cell × paged`      — the Phase-2/3 tier-O/tier-P oracle posture, Safe;
////   - `threaded × paged`  — tier-P instance state (== the `portable` core), Safe;
////   - `cell × atomics`    — tier-O O(1) memory under the pdict calling convention, Safe;
////   - `threaded × atomics`— tier-O O(1) memory under record-threading, Safe;
////   - `cell × nif`        — the tier-N ceiling skeleton (Unsafe-only, delegates to paged).
//// WebAssembly is deterministic (the only non-determinism is NaN payload bits, which D5 pins as
//// raw patterns), so a correct `atomics` store and a correct `paged` store produce byte-identical
//// memory images ⇒ identical `Outcome`s (spec §4.4 — every ill-defined op traps; no undefined
//// behaviour to diverge on). A single tier/strategy regression on any allowlisted assertion (a
//// mis-endianned `atomics` load, a threaded record dropped across a call, an `ets` table miss)
//// goes red on that file. Each binding is built via `combos.binding_for` (D1 — the unit-07
//// profile/linker surface, bounded `cap_pages` so an atomics combo links), then driven through the
//// SAME `run_suite` gate. The two Phase-3 profiles stay as two more matrix points.
////
//// ## Phase 5 — the surface-phase headline: `fail == 0 && pass > baseline` (capstone P5-12 proof 2)
////
//// Unlike Phases 3–4 (which added NO IR nodes and NO spec files, so the counts did not move),
//// Phase 5 is a SURFACE phase: whole `.wast` categories light up (reference types, bulk memory,
//// multi-memory, the `spectest` imports, the WAT-only text-format asserts), so on the enlarged
//// allowlist (P5-11) the pinned suite's `pass` STRICTLY RISES while `fail` stays `0`. The two
//// FULL-profile runs (`spec_suite_safe`/`unsafe`, the unfiltered 21525-pass runs) therefore carry
//// the surface-phase headline directly: `fail == 0 && pass > phase4_baseline_pass` (`run_suite`).
//// The residual-skip accounting — every remaining skip is one of the ENUMERATED honest categories,
//// the CLOSED-residual invariant — is owned by `skipcount_test.gleam` (P5-11) and CONFIRMED green by
//// the capstone (D1: the capstone references it, it does not re-derive the phrase list). The honest
//// reading: the headline is a pass-RISE (+5776), NOT a naive skip-drop — the raw skip count rose
//// because P5-11 added ~30 previously-EXCLUDED files to the allowlist, so most of the 1257 residual
//// is asserts in files that were never counted before Phase 5; ~1088 of it is cross-module
//// wasm→wasm FUNCTION imports (a distinct cross-module function-linking feature Phase 5 never
//// scoped → Phase 6), and 169 is genuinely out-of-scope (GC-proposal reftypes, extended-const,
//// `assert_exhaustion`, cross-module state import, SIMD/GC text). `fail == 0` under every shipped
//// binding is the whole-phase net; the FILTERED matrix combos keep the non-vacuity `pass > 0` gate.
////
//// Tier-A needs NO engine at run time: the expected values are baked into the vendored `.wast`
//// (now JSON). The committed curated fixture subset makes this run in a fresh checkout;
//// `vendor/vendor.sh` regenerates the FULL allowlist (gitignored) for a wider local run — the
//// runner adapts to whatever `*.json` are present.
////
//// Gate: zero genuine FAILS (a fail is a real spec mismatch in the pipeline); SKIPS are expected
//// and printed (constructs beyond the slice — reference types, bulk memory, multi-memory,
//// non-function imports, multi-value, extended-const, memory64, text-format asserts, and the
//// allowlist files un-convertible at the pin). At least one PASS is required so the suite is not
//// vacuously green.
