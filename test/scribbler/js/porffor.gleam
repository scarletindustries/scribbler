//// `porffor` — the JS toolchain adapter (P7-09 §B): Porffor (the compiler + reference executor)
//// and Node (the ground-truth JS oracle), shelled out through the generic, unowned conformance
//// FFI (`ffi.run`/`ffi.find_executable`). Skips GRACEFULLY when a toolchain is absent (the
//// `wasmtime.available()` precedent) so the suite still judges every program from the baked
//// `.expected`.
////
//// The two invocations (MEASURED, Porffor 0.61.13):
//// - `npx porffor <src.js>` — compile-and-execute; its stdout is the reference console output
////   (the T13 fair oracle: V8 running the SAME `.wasm` carder consumes). Exit 0 = clean; exit 1 =
////   the program threw uncaught.
//// - `node <src.js>` — the ground-truth JS semantics (Tier-B secondary), distinguishing "carder
////   reproduced correct JS" from "Porffor is wrong" (§E.2).
////
//// `ffi.run` folds stderr into stdout, so for a CLEAN (exit-0) program the returned bytes ARE the
//// stdout console stream; for a threw (exit-1) program the bytes carry the error text too, so the
//// live differential byte-compares only the clean programs (the baked `.expected` — stdout only —
//// judges the rest, §E.3). Every function here is TOTAL.
