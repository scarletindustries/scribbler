//// Unit 10a / Phase-2 unit 08 — WASM `full` validation (the security boundary).
////
//// `validate/1` proves a decoded `wasm.Module` well-typed per the WebAssembly
//// core spec's validation rules (<https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/>)
//// using the abstract stack-typing algorithm from the appendix
//// (<https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/appendix/algorithm.html>). It is the
//// **security boundary** (overview D4/D9): the input AST is populated from
//// UNTRUSTED bytes, so every malformation is reported as a typed `ValidateError`
//// and the validator never panics, `let assert`s, or diverges (fail-closed).
////
//// This module reads `scribbler/wasm/ast` ONLY — it has **no dependency on
//// the shared IR** (so its conformance gates independently of the backend, per the
//// unit doc). The output `TypedModule` carries exactly the typing facts the lowering
//// stage (`lower.gleam`, 10b / unit 09) needs so lowering never re-derives types.
////
//// Phase 2 (unit 08) extends the Phase-1 algorithm — the polymorphic-stack /
//// label / else-less-`if` / `max_locals` machinery is kept verbatim — with typing
//// for the new ops: the load/store width matrix (+ memarg alignment), `memory.size`/
//// `memory.grow`, `global.get`/`global.set` (incl. the **mutability** check),
//// `call_indirect` (typeidx + table-presence), the float arith/unary/copysign/compare
//// ops, the full `0xA7–0xBF` int↔float conversion block, and `select`. It adds the
//// **module-level** checks (limits, ≤1 memory/table, in-range func/type/global
//// indices, the `start` signature) and **constant-expression** validation for global
//// initializers and element/data segment offsets.
////
//// Phase 5 (unit P5-04) completes the standardized surface (minus SIMD) — again
//// keeping the polymorphic-stack machinery verbatim. It types the **reference**
//// instructions (`ref.null`/`ref.func` + the `C.refs` declared-reference set /
//// `ref.is_null`), **typed `select t`** and the untyped-`select` reference
//// restriction, **reftype-typed tables** with `table.get/set/size/grow/fill` and
//// **multiple tables**, the **bulk memory & table** ops (`memory.init/copy/fill`,
//// `data.drop`, `table.init/copy`, `elem.drop`) with their `dataidx`/`elemidx`/
//// `memidx`/`tableidx` bounds and reftype-match rules, **multi-memory** `memidx`
//// routing (the Phase-2 `≤1 memory / ≤1 table` caps are LIFTED per H3), **memory64**
//// `i64`-address typing (decode/validate-only — runtime deferred to Phase 6, R12),
//// **non-function imports** wired into the `imports ++ defined` index spaces, and the
//// passive/declarative element + passive data segment grammar. The `TypedModule` now
//// also carries the reftypes of tables/element-segments, the memories' address
//// widths, the per-kind imported counts, and `C.refs`, so lowering (P5-05) never
//// re-derives them.
////
//// Phase 6 (unit P6-04) closes the last gap in the standardized surface — again
//// keeping the polymorphic-stack / label machinery verbatim. It types the
//// **fixed-width SIMD** instruction set (`«WASM-AST4»`): `v128` as a vector value
//// type on the abstract stack (permitted by untyped `select`, rejected by
//// `ref.is_null` — it is NOT a reference type), the pure lane-wise ops
//// (`ast.Simd(op)`, exhaustive on `SimdOp`) with their spec abstract-stack
//// signatures (comparisons yield a `v128` lane **mask**, not `i32`), the lane-immediate
//// bounds (`extract_lane`/`replace_lane` `lane < dim`, `i8x16.shuffle` indices `< 32`,
//// `load/store{N}_lane` `lane < 128/N`) as `BadLaneIndex`, and the v128 memory family
//// (`SimdLoad`/`SimdStore`/`SimdLoadLane`/`SimdStoreLane`) routed through the SAME
//// `mem_addr_type`/`check_align`/`check_offset` seam as scalar loads (so `v128.load` on
//// a 64-bit memory pops an `i64` address — the memory64 seam). Every SIMD `Instr` is
//// intercepted BEFORE the `numeric_sig` fallthrough (S1 — the fail-closed security
//// invariant): an ill-typed / out-of-range-lane / over-aligned SIMD program is
//// REJECTED, never silently accepted. memory64 typing (P5) is re-confirmed spec-complete
//// (its runtime now lands in Phase 6), and cross-module function-import typing is
//// unchanged — a `call` to an imported function type-checks against its declared
//// `FuncType` in the imports-first func space (the link-time satisfaction is P6-09's).
//// A module with no `v128` validates **byte-identically** to Phase 5 (I7).
////
//// Strength: **`full`** (the only Phase-1 strength — required for untrusted input;
//// `subset`/`assume_valid` are deferred and are NOT a default, D9).

///   instruction lane rule) — `extract_lane`/`replace_lane` with `lane >= dim(shape)`,
///   an `i8x16.shuffle` index `>= 32`, or a `load/store{8,16,32,64}_lane` with

/// - `OffsetOutOfRange`: a load/store memarg static offset `>= 2^32` on a **32-bit**
///   (`Idx32`) memory (spec `valid/instructions` memarg). Reachable now that decode
///   reads the offset as a `u64` (P5-03); routed from `align.wast`'s "offset out of

/// - `UndeclaredFunctionRef(index)`: a `ref.func x` whose `x` is a valid funcidx but
///   **not** in `C.refs` (the module's declared-reference set). The spec requires
///   `x ∈ C.refs` (spec `valid/instructions` ref.func; `ref_func.wast`
///   `assert_invalid`). Distinct from `UnknownFunc` (which is x out of range).
/// - `RefTypeMismatch`: a **reference-type** disagreement that is not an operand-stack
///   pop mismatch — `table.init`/`table.copy` across mismatched reftypes, an active
///   element segment whose reftype ≠ its target table's, or `call_indirect` through a
///   non-`funcref` table (spec `valid/instructions`/`valid/modules`). Operand-stack
///   reftype mismatches (e.g. `table.set` fed the wrong reftype) use `TypeMismatch`.
/// - `BadSelectType`: an untyped `select` (0x1B) on a **reference** operand (invalid —
///   untyped select is number-typed only), or a typed `select t` (0x1C) whose
///   annotation vector is not exactly length 1 (spec parametric rule; `select.wast`).
/// - `UnknownImportKind(detail)`: an import/export whose referent index is out of the
///   space its kind selects, where no more specific `Unknown*` fits, or a **duplicate
///   export name** (spec `valid/modules` forbids duplicate export names). Carries a
///   human-readable detail.
/// - `UnknownTag(index)` (Phase 7): a `throw`/`try_table` catch / legacy `catch` /
///   `tag`-export tagidx out of range of the module's tag index space (imports ++
///   defined) — spec: the EH proposal requires `C.tags[x]` to exist. Analogous to
///   `UnknownFunc`/`UnknownMemory`. Distinct from `UnknownType` (a *tag declaration*'s
///   out-of-range typeidx at module setup, a declaration error, versus a *use-site*
///   out-of-range tagidx). Carries the offending index.
/// - `BadTagType` (Phase 7): a tag (defined or imported) whose referenced `FuncType`
///   has a **non-empty result list** — the EH proposal requires a tag's type to be
///   `[t*] -> []` (an exception carries operands but never returns). Analogous to
///   `BadStartType` (the `[] -> []` start rule); carries no index (message text is not
///   asserted by the conformance runner, only the variant).
/// - `InvalidSubtype(detail)` (GC): a **type-section declaration** that violates the
///   GC sub-typing rules for a declared `sub` clause (spec `valid/types`, the
///   `subtype` rule) — a supertype that is `final` (may not be extended), a supertype
///   of a **different composite kind** (a struct extending a func, …), or a composite
///   that is not **structurally a subtype** of its declared supertype (func params
///   not contravariant / results not covariant; struct with fewer or mismatched
///   fields; array element not field-matching). Carries a human-readable `detail`;
///   the conformance runner asserts only that the module is rejected (any `Error`),
