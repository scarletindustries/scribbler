//// THE LIVE DIFFERENTIAL (P7-09 §E, Tier-B) — re-confirm the corpus against a live Porffor + Node.
////
//// Tier-A (`js_conformance_test`) judges every program against the BAKED `.expected`. This unit
//// re-confirms those bakes against a LIVE toolchain when one is installed (skipping gracefully,
//// recorded, when absent — the `wasmtime` differential precedent), giving two live proofs:
////
//// 1. **`beam == porf run`** (the T13 fair oracle): carder's captured console output equals Porffor's
////    OWN execution of the SAME `.wasm` byte-for-byte (color in-band) for every CLEAN program, and
////    matches the outcome class (both threw) for every uncaught-throw program. A divergence here is a
////    real carder bug — this is the strongest differential (same compiled artifact, same reference).
//// 2. **the porf-vs-node categorization** (§E.2): re-derives, live, that every expected-pass program
////    agrees `porf == node` and every documented `PorfforVsNodeDivergence` program actually diverges
////    `porf != node` — so the skip categories are live-verified Porffor bugs, not stale bakes.
