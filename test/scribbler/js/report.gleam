//// `report` — the honest JS-on-the-BEAM coverage ledger (P7-09 §F, S11/D9).
////
//// The Phase-7 headline is a NUMBER and a categorized residual: how many real JS programs,
//// compiled by Porffor and run through carder on the BEAM, produce output byte-identical to
//// Porffor's own execution (`porf run`, T13) — with every non-green program a TYPED, PRINTED
//// skip, never a false green. This module owns the ledger types (`Verdict`, `SkipCategory`,
//// `JsReport`), the accumulator, and the printed coverage table. It decides NO equality itself
//// (the judge lives in the conformance test, §E) — it only records + renders what the judge
//// returned, so the residual is a closed enum, not a free string.

/// Why a corpus program is not a `Pass` — a CLOSED enum (S11/D9), so a program the harness cannot
/// turn green becomes a typed, printed skip, never an untracked "it didn't work". The categories
/// (§A.1):
/// - `PorfforUncompilable(diag)` — `porffor wasm` errored / non-zero exit: the JS is outside
///   Porffor's ~1/3-of-ECMA coverage (J8). NOT a carder gap.
/// - `UnprovidedIntrinsic(name)` — the `.wasm` imports a `""` intrinsic P7-08's shim does not
///   provide → the link fails CLOSED (never a silent stub).
/// - `CarderGap(stage)` — a compile-stage rejection: scribbler's decode/validate/lower or carder's
///   ir-lower/emit/build REJECTED a construct the engine does not yet handle; carries the pipeline
///   stage prefix. A real, named engine gap. (The name predates the carder/scribbler split and is
///   kept stable — it means "a gap in the wasm→BEAM engine", either half.)
/// - `PorfforVsNodeDivergence(note)` — Porffor's output != Node's: a *Porffor* bug we cannot hold
///   carder to (carder still reproduces Porffor's wasm faithfully — beam == porf — but "pass" is
///   reserved for reproducing *correct* JS, so this is a skip). The note records the divergence.
/// - `ReferenceUnavailable` — neither a baked `.expected` nor a live reference is present.

/// - `Fail(reason)` — Porffor compiled it + carder ran it, but the BEAM output/outcome DIVERGED
///   from Porffor's own execution — a real carder bug (the target of the whole harness).
