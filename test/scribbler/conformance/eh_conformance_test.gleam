//// Unit P7-10 — the CAPSTONE EH-engine conformance run (proof 1, the "engine spec-correct"
//// half). This file drives the OFFICIAL WebAssembly exception-handling `.wast` suite through the
//// full carder pipeline and asserts `fail == 0`, `pass > 0`, with every residual categorized
//// honestly (R16/S11 — greenness is MEASURED, never promised). It is the Phase-7 analogue of
//// P6-10's `simd_conformance_test.gleam`: the coarse whole-file proof behind the fine-grained,
//// deliberately-authored EH backstop (`new_surface_test.gleam`, this unit).
////
//// ## What actually converts at the pin (MEASURED — the honest scope of proof 2)
////
//// Empirically checked at `vendor/PIN` (testsuite SHA 193e551…, wabt 1.0.41) with
//// `wast2json --enable-exceptions`:
////
////   | official `.wast`         | encoding | wast2json@pin | driven green? | why |
////   |--------------------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-----|
////   | `throw.wast`             | modern   | ✅ converts    | ✅ | tag section + `throw` + `try_table` catch |
////   | `throw_ref.wast`         | modern   | ✅ converts    | ✅ | `try_table catch_ref` + `throw_ref` + `exnref` |
////   | `legacy/throw.wast`      | legacy   | ✅ converts    | ✅ | `try`/`catch` (the encoding PORFFOR emits) |
////   | `legacy/rethrow.wast`    | legacy   | ✅ converts    | ✅ | `try`/`catch` + `rethrow` |
////   | `legacy/try_catch.wast`  | legacy   | ✅ converts (P13 `--enable-tail-call`) | ❌ | cross-module EH function+tag import `(import "test" …)` — a plain `call` (NOT tail-call) |
////   | `legacy/try_delegate.wast`| legacy  | ✅ converts (P13 `--enable-tail-call`) | ❌ | legacy `delegate` label-targeting semantics (NOT tail-call) + `return_call` inside a `try` must abandon the enclosing (dynamically-scoped BEAM) handler |
////   | `tag.wast`               | modern   | ❌ `(rec …)`    | ❌ | GC recursive type groups — OUT OF SCOPE (Phase 8 GC) |
////   | `try_table.wast`         | modern   | ❌ `(ref null $t)`/`exn` | ❌ | typed refs / GC `exn` heap type — OUT OF SCOPE (NOT tail-call) |
////
//// **Phase-13 measured reality (R16 — report the reality, not the plan).** 6 of the 8 official EH
//// files now CONVERT at the pin: Phase 13 landed the tail-call proposal, so `legacy/try_catch.wast`
//// + `legacy/try_delegate.wast` (which use `return_call`/`return_call_indirect`) `wast2json`-convert
//// with `--enable-exceptions --enable-tail-call` (`spectest-interp` 42/42 + 26/26). But driving them
//// END-TO-END shows they were NOT "blocked purely on `return_call`": they exercise a scope DEEPER
//// than the tail-call feature — cross-module EH function+tag imports (`try_catch`'s `imported-mismatch`,
//// a plain `call`), legacy `delegate` LABEL-TARGETING (`try_delegate`'s `delegate-skip`/
//// `delegate-correct-targets`, no `return_call` at all), and the `return_call`-inside-`try`
//// interaction (a WASM tail call must ABANDON the enclosing handler, but a BEAM `try/catch` is
//// DYNAMICALLY scoped, so a tail `apply` inside it stays in the handler's extent). Those are
//// EH-lowering / cross-module / emit-seam concerns, NOT tail-call — so the CONVERSION bar is met
//// (both files vendored) while DRIVING them green stays categorized-deferred (see `eh_unconvertible`),
//// honestly (never a false green). The 4 driven files exercise BOTH encodings carder decodes into the
//// one neutral IR (T1/T2): the modern `try_table`/`throw`/`throw_ref`/`exnref` surface AND the legacy
//// `try`/`catch`/`rethrow` form Porffor actually emits.
////
//// ## The run (proof 1, MEASURED)
////
//// The 4 driven files are vendored (via `vendor.sh`'s EH section) into `fixtures/eh/` — a
//// SUBDIRECTORY the main `conformance_test.gleam` top-level glob does not see, so they add NOTHING
//// to the main headline (which is 46646/1771/0 after Phase 13 folded the two tail-call `.wast` into
//// the main allowlist — the EH files are driven HERE, not there). This file drives them under all
//// THREE shipped profiles —
//// `profiles.safe()` (Baseline optimizer + enforcing fuel, Cell), `profiles.unsafe()` (Aggressive
//// optimizer + open runtime, Cell), and `profiles.portable()` (Threaded/Paged/`bif`, the
//// runs-anywhere core) — and asserts, per file and in aggregate, `fail == 0 && pass > 0`.
////
//// **MEASURED tier reach (the precise T6 bound):** EH is BEAM-native control flow — a throw
//// unwinds the process's native stack, not the `state_strategy` record/cell — so the state-FREE EH
//// surface (the entire official `.wast` suite + the JS/Porffor subset) runs BYTE-IDENTICALLY under
//// Cell AND Threaded (`portable`), verified here (all four driven files green under all three profiles).
//// The T6 "Cell-only" bound is retained for exactly ONE combination it names: a program that
//// MUTATES threaded instance state and then relies on that mutation SURVIVING a throw/catch —
//// under `threaded` the state travels as a data-threaded value a throw unwinds PAST, so post-catch
//// state is the pre-try state (a categorized-unsupported combo). None of these files exercise it,
//// and the JS/Porffor path avoids it (it is Cell). So "runs-anywhere for the EH surface" holds.
////
//// The `assert_exception` commands (an uncaught `throw` unwinding out of the invoke) are judged by
//// the run-ABI's WASM-exception outcome (T8 — a `{wasm_exn,…}` reason class, distinct from a
//// `{wasm_trap,…}`), the `assert_return` commands by the ordinary numeric/reference oracle, and the
//// `assert_invalid` commands by the fail-closed frontend (a malformed tag / bad `try_table` type is
//// rejected).
////
//// Spec anchors: the WebAssembly exception-handling proposal
//// (<https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling>) — the tag section (id 13), `throw` (0x08),
//// `try_table` (0x1F) + catch clauses 0x00–0x03, `throw_ref` (0x0A), the `exnref` heap type, and
//// the legacy `try` (0x06)/`catch` (0x07)/`catch_all` (0x19)/`rethrow` (0x09); spec §4.4/§4.4.9
//// (uncaught → embedder, innermost-matching-handler unwinding). Every baked value is
//// `spectest-interp`-verified self-consistent at vendor time, so "green" means every spec-
//// observable EH behaviour was preserved, never "it compiled".
