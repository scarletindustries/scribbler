//// `corpus` — the JS-subset conformance corpus manifest (P7-09 §C).
////
//// One `Program` per `corpus/<category>/<name>.js`, grown trivial -> real across the breadth of
//// Porffor-supported JS (arithmetic + precedence + Math; control flow; functions; closures;
//// recursion; strings; arrays; objects; booleans/logical; `try/catch`/`throw`). Each program is
//// self-contained and prints its observable(s) via `console.log`, so the observable is a
//// deterministic byte-stream the differential oracle judges (§E).
////
//// The manifest is the SINGLE source of truth for the corpus. For every program it also bakes the
//// two facts the judge needs but cannot read from the `.wasm`: the program's `Outcome` at
//// `porf run` (Clean vs an uncaught Throw) and — cross-checked against Node at vendor time
//// (`vendor.sh`) — an optional `SkipCategory` when Porffor's own output diverges from correct JS
//// (`porf run != node`, a Porffor bug we do not hold carder to, §E.2). A program with `skip: None`
//// is expected to run byte-identically to `porf run` AND reproduce correct JS; a `skip: Some(_)`
//// program is a DOCUMENTED, categorized non-green (kept, never deleted — DoD).
////
//// MEASURED against Porffor 0.61.13 + Node v22 (see `PIN`): 55 programs, 52 expected-pass, 3
//// `PorfforVsNodeDivergence` (`arith/negzero` `-0`->`"0"`; `closures/counter`/`closures/adder`
//// Porffor's broken lexical-closure capture -> `NaN`/`ReferenceError`). carder reproduces `porf run`
//// byte-for-byte on ALL 55 (including the 3 divergent ones), so `fail == 0` and the residual is
//// bounded by Porffor, not carder (J8).
