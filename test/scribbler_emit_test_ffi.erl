%% Test-only FFI shim for the unit-08 (`emit_core`) end-to-end tests.

%% Hand-written Erlang, so it carries the `carder_` namespace prefix (overview §5).
%% It exists only to drive a freshly-compiled-and-loaded generated module and to
%% capture a trap / capability-denial *without crashing the test process* (Gleam on
%% OTP 29 has no generic exception-rescue in this dependency set). It does not touch
%% any unit-owned source file.

%% Apply a fun VALUE to an argument list: `erlang:apply(Fun, Args)`. On a normal
%% return yield `{ok, V}` (a Gleam `Ok`); a raise/exit/throw is captured as
%% `{error, Reason}` (Reason as a UTF-8 binary), mirroring `catch_apply/3`. Used by
%% the Phase-8 unit-02 closure tests to apply a `MakeClosure` fun that was RETURNED
%% from an exported function — proving a native BEAM `fun` outlives its creating
%% frame and is applied via `erlang:apply` from outside the generated module.

%% Raw `erlang:apply(M, F, Args)` with NO trap capture — the value is returned
%% directly and any raise/exit/throw PROPAGATES. Used by the P6-06 cross-module
%% end-to-end test to build a linker-style dispatch closure that routes a
%% `CallImport` into another carder-compiled module's exported function (a genuine
%% WASM→WASM call across two loaded modules; a callee trap must propagate, not be
%% swallowed).

%% rendered as a UTF-8 binary (a Gleam `String`) so the caller can assert on its
%% text (e.g. that a trap surfaced as `{wasm_trap, int_div_by_zero}`).
