//// Self-test for the `wat_fixture` adapter (unit P5-11 §E, H5) — an IN-SCOPE `.wast` script runs
//// end-to-end FROM our own WAT parser (`wat.parse_script`) through the harness `Driver`, proving the
//// parser-driven path is a faithful second frontend (not a fixture crutch). The `.wast` carries its
//// own baked-in expected values (Tier-A, spec-sourced), so a wrong result / missing trap goes red.
////
//// It exercises: a `(module …)` definition, `assert_return` (incl. i32 wrap + a memory store/load),
//// `assert_trap` (div-by-zero → spec phrase), a `(module quote …)` `assert_malformed` REJECTED at
//// parse, and `(register …)` + a `$name`-targeted invoke. The un-`wast2json`-able real suite files
//// (`memory.wast`/`table.wast`/`select.wast`) are genuinely out of scope for BOTH wabt and our
//// parser (GC reference types / `(module definition)` module-linking), so they stay categorised
//// skips (R16); this authored file is the in-scope proof the adapter itself is correct.
