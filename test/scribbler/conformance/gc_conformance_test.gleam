//// Unit P8 — the CAPSTONE WebAssembly-GC conformance run. Drives the OFFICIAL WebAssembly GC
//// `.wast` suite through the full carder pipeline (decode → validate → lower → emit → BEAM) and
//// asserts `fail == 0`, `pass > 0` on the driven-green set, with every residual categorized
//// honestly (R16/S11 — greenness is MEASURED, never promised). The GC analogue of
//// `eh_conformance_test.gleam`.
////
//// ## Vendoring (why wasm-tools, not wabt)
////
//// wabt 1.0.41 (the pinned MVP toolchain) cannot tokenize GC struct/array/i31 text or GC abstract
//// heap types — an upstream gap (wabt issue #2530; `--enable-gc` is a CLI facade with no parser).
//// So the GC suite is vendored with `wasm-tools json-from-wast` (which fully parses GC and emits a
//// wast2json-compatible `.json` + `.wasm` set) into `fixtures/gc/` — a SUBDIRECTORY the main
//// `conformance_test` top-level `.json` glob does not see, so the Phase-1..6 headline stays
//// byte-identical (the GC suite is driven HERE, not folded into the main allowlist). See the GC
//// section of `vendor/vendor.sh`.
////
//// ## What is driven green (MEASURED at the pin: testsuite 193e551…, wasm-tools 1.253.0)
////
//// 15 of the 23 top-level GC `.wast` files run GREEN end-to-end (`fail == 0`) — the struct/array/
//// i31 value surface, `ref.test`/`ref.cast`/`ref.eq`, `br_on_cast[_fail]`, the segment-sourced
//// array ops, and the type declaration/equivalence/canonicalization suites. This exercises the
//// GC engine carder added: struct/array/i31 allocation + access lowered onto a per-process arena of
//// `{gc,Id}`/`{i31,V}` handles (opt-in by pure reachability DCE, Safe-admissible); GC constant
//// expressions (`ref.i31`/`struct.new`/`array.new*` in globals & element segments); spec-conformant
//// GC trap messages; and iso-recursive type-section validation + concrete-heap-type canonicalization
//// (`sub`/finality/kind/structural-subtyping checks; canon-equal cross-rec-group identity).
////
//// ## The categorized residual (`gc_residual` — NOT driven green; honest, per R16)
////
//// 8 files carry residual failures, each a MEASURED engine gap OUTSIDE the value surface — chiefly
//// RUNTIME type identity that would need a canonical type id to survive lowering (GC concrete refs
//// erase to the neutral term ABI): cross-module import matching (`assert_unlinkable`), the
//// `call_indirect` runtime subtype check, and `ref.test`/`ref.cast` against an actual funcref. See
//// the per-file reasons below. These are deliberately deferred (they touch the funcref/table path
//// shared by the whole main suite), never a false green.
