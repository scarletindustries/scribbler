//// THE HEADLINE PROOF (P7-08) — a real Porffor-compiled JS program runs end-to-end on the BEAM
//// via carder, for the EH-free subset (T12).
////
//// Each program was compiled by **Porffor 0.61.13** (`porffor wasm foo.js foo.wasm`, committed
//// under `fixtures/`) and its byte-exact `porf run` output measured (`od -An -tx1`, T13). The
//// deterministic test runs each committed `.wasm` through the FULL carder pipeline
//// (decode → validate → lower → emit → build_beam → load → instantiate → invoke `"m"`) under
//// `scribbler/porffor/host.binding()`, drains the console output, and asserts it is **byte-identical** to the
//// measured `porf run` output — ANSI escapes in-band (T11). The guarded differential re-checks
//// against a LIVE `porf run` when Porffor is on `PATH` (skips gracefully otherwise, like the
//// wasmtime differential). These programs are EH-FREE (verified: `wasm-tools validate` passes at
//// the wasm-2.0 baseline, zero tags/throws), so they run on the Phase-6 engine + the shim
//// WITHOUT the EH pipeline. **This is JS running on the BEAM.**
