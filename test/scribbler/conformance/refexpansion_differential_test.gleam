//// The new-surface tier differential (unit P5-11 §H) — the reference-types / bulk-memory /
//// multi-memory acceptance programs run under EVERY shipped `(state_strategy × mem_tier)`
//// combination, asserting (a) each program is spec-correct against its `.expected` under every
//// combo, and (b) its outcomes are BYTE-IDENTICAL across all combos (H7 — a varied tier axis
//// changes no observable). Reuses the P4-09 `combos.binding_for` / `combos.evaluate` /
//// `combos.identity_across` machinery UNCHANGED (this unit consumes the public surface; it does not
//// add these programs to `combos.corpus_programs`, which is P4-09's const — §H seam note).
////
//// The load-bearing spec corners (H2/H6): reftab's null-slot `call_indirect` → `uninitialized
//// element` and an OOB `table.get` → `out of bounds table access`; bulkmem's eager-bounds trap with
//// NO partial write and memmove-correct overlap, plus a dropped passive segment behaving as
//// length-0; multimem's independent regions + a `memory.copy` ACROSS memories. A tier that did a
//// naïve forward copy, wrote before checking bounds, mis-endianned an atomics store, or dropped a
//// threaded record across a table op diverges HERE on the exact program. Every `.expected` value is
//// spec-sourced (Tier-A), so "green" means every spec-observable was preserved, never "it compiled".
